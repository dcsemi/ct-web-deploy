      <description>We developed device for welding long welds. The device is mainly designed for welding long welds of fillet welds and butt welds by methods MIG or MAG. Advantages of this device is simultaneous welding from two sides. Its main components consist of a support frame with a longitudinal positioning table for workpieces and a horizontal linear track with a traversing carriage. This track includes a carriage drive, wire feeders, welding torches, technological torches with vertical and horizontal correction supports, welding torch holders, and a control unit.</description>

      <description>Safan E-Brake B 100-3100 The E-Brake incorporates all the benefits of the proven servo-electric drive concept. The transfer of pressing force relies on a mechanism with flat belts and a set of rotating wheels on roller bearings. Thanks to incomparably higher acceleration and deceleration of the ram, it achieves greater productivity compared to hydraulic presses.&#xA;Parameters Value Maximum bending force 1 000 kN Maximum working length 3 100 mm BENDMAK | CY SERIES 3-ROLL Intial pinch plate rolls The Bendmak CY Series 3 Roll Initial Pinch style of plate rolls are the most popular style for thinner material requirements.</description>
