One of the most crucial tests we conduct is on offshore welding structures, where we have our own testing equipment. This includes a testing tower with a hydraulic cylinder capable of exerting a force of up to 100 tons. We perform two types of tests: production tests and prototype tests.
Additionally, we provide pressure tests and leak tests for welded structures such as tanks, containers, pipes, and more.</description></item></channel></rss>
