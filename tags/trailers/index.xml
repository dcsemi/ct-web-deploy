      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our additional long-standing expertise lies in the production of cargo trailers. Here, we excel in collaboration with our customers by processing our own technical documentation. Typically, in this sector, we deal with small-batch production. We are capable of working with high-strength and wear-resistant quenched steels, such as S600 MC, Weldox 900, and others. Subsequently, in this field, we have implemented our own automated process for welding long seams. We manufacture trailers of various lengths, ranging from 6 to 12 m.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
