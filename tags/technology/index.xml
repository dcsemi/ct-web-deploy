Our commitment to excellence is reflected in our use of advanced techniques, including MIG (131), MAG (135), and TIG (141). From concept to creation, our metal fabrication services cover a wide spectrum, including structural steel, aluminium, and stainless steel fabrication. We understand that each project is unique. That&amp;rsquo;s why International Welding Engineer (IWE) is an integral part of our team.</description></item><item><title>Welding automation</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</guid><description>We developed device for welding long welds. The device is mainly designed for welding long welds of fillet welds and butt welds by methods MIG or MAG. Advantages of this device is simultaneous welding from two sides. Its main components consist of a support frame with a longitudinal positioning table for workpieces and a horizontal linear track with a traversing carriage. This track includes a carriage drive, wire feeders, welding torches, technological torches with vertical and horizontal correction supports, welding torch holders, and a control unit.</description></item><item><title>Laser cutting</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</guid><description>Laser Genius+ 2040 6kW, PRIMA POWER, (Fiber technology) Laser Genius+ is combined with the new fiber laser head, new electronics and innovative mounting for the optics and centering system, guarantee a maximum level of precision and cutting quality.
