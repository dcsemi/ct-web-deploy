Here, we excel in collaboration with our customers by processing our own technical documentation. Typically, in this sector, we deal with small-batch production. We are capable of working with high-strength and wear-resistant quenched steels, such as S600 MC, Weldox 900, and others. Subsequently, in this field, we have implemented our own automated process for welding long seams. We manufacture trailers of various lengths, ranging from 6 m to 12 m.</description></item><item><title>Welding automation</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</guid><description>CTP 1350 We developed device for welding long welds. The device is mainly designed for welding long welds of fillet welds and butt welds by methods MIG or MAG. Advantages of this device is simultaneous welding from two sides. Its main components consist of a support frame with a longitudinal positioning table for workpieces and a horizontal linear track with a traversing carriage. This track includes a carriage drive, wire feeders, welding torches, technological torches with vertical and horizontal correction supports, welding torch holders, and a control unit.</description></item><item><title>Laser cutting</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</guid><description>Laser Genius+ 2040 6kW, PRIMA POWER, (Fiber technology) Laser Genius+ is combined with the new fiber laser head, new electronics and innovative mounting for the optics and centering system, guarantee a maximum level of precision and cutting quality.

Our dedicated workshop enables us to weld smaller, lighter weldments compared to the production of containers or trailers. Here, we have experience in manufacturing food industry structures, pipes, tanks, and various other welded components. In this field, we have also encountered heat-resistant stainless steels.</description></item><item><title>Press brake and roll bending</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/press-brake-roll-bending/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/press-brake-roll-bending/</guid><description>Safan E-Brake B 100-3100 The E-Brake incorporates all the benefits of the proven servo-electric drive concept. The transfer of pressing force relies on a mechanism with flat belts and a set of rotating wheels on roller bearings. Thanks to incomparably higher acceleration and deceleration of the ram, it achieves greater productivity compared to hydraulic presses.
