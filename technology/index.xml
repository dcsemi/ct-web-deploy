Our commitment to excellence is reflected in our use of advanced techniques, including MIG (131), MAG (135), and TIG (141). From concept to creation, our metal fabrication services cover a wide spectrum, including structural steel, aluminium, and stainless steel fabrication. We understand that each project is unique. That&amp;rsquo;s why International Welding Engineer (IWE) is an integral part of our team.</description></item><item><title>Welding automation</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/welding-automation/</guid><description>We developed device for welding long welds. The device is mainly designed for welding long welds of fillet welds and butt welds by methods MIG or MAG. Advantages of this device is simultaneous welding from two sides. Its main components consist of a support frame with a longitudinal positioning table for workpieces and a horizontal linear track with a traversing carriage. This track includes a carriage drive, wire feeders, welding torches, technological torches with vertical and horizontal correction supports, welding torch holders, and a control unit.</description></item><item><title>Laser cutting</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/laser-cutting/</guid><description>Laser Genius+ 2040 6kW, PRIMA POWER, (Fiber technology) Laser Genius+ is combined with the new fiber laser head, new electronics and innovative mounting for the optics and centering system, guarantee a maximum level of precision and cutting quality.

One of the most crucial tests we conduct is on offshore welding structures, where we have our own testing equipment. This includes a testing tower with a hydraulic cylinder capable of exerting a force of up to 100 tons. We perform two types of tests: production tests and prototype tests.
Additionally, we provide pressure tests and leak tests for welded structures such as tanks, containers, pipes, and more.</description></item><item><title>Engineering</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/engineering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/engineering/</guid><description>The company is capable of processing the necessary technical documentation, such as reading and understanding manufacturing drawings. It can also handle 3D models, utilizing Solid Edge 2019 software for this purpose. The team consists of skilled individuals who are not afraid to take on projects. They can work even with less than perfect technical documentation. If needed, they can redraw manufacturing drawings for their production needs and choose the simplest and most cost-effective manufacturing technology.</description></item><item><title>Blasting</title><link>https://ct-products.cz/technology/blasting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 23:51:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ct-products.cz/technology/blasting/</guid><description>We have a spray booth where we perform surface treatment by blasting with fine glass beads. We blast stainless steel or aluminium parts. Through this process, the materialâ€™s surface acquires a uniform velvet appearance.
