The containers are of the “offshore” type which means they are certified according to respective standards for reloading on an open sea.
We perform two types of testing Production test Production test where the primary structure of the container is tested for the required load (up to 100 tons) and the container is gripped at 2 or 4 points.
Prototype testing Prototype test, in particular the fall test, where the primary structure of the prototype is dropped from a special hinge to the ground.</description></item><item><title>Cargo chasis trailers</title><link>http://ct-products.cz/products/cargo-chasis-trailers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ct-products.cz/products/cargo-chasis-trailers/</guid><description>At our engineering company, we use only the highest quality carbon steel in the production of our cargo chassis trailers.
